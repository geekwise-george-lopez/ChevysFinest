	<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">The club was introduced by 
	Javier and George in May of 2005. The reason for this club is to let every 
	one know that we belong a club. That and to look cool with a big ass sticker in 
	the back window saying that we belong to an association. A Chevrolet Club. 
	This club is only Chevrolet Vehicle owners ONLY. Which means no GMC,&nbsp; 
	TOYOTA, DODGE, and especially FORD's. Even though Chevrolet and GMC is 
	distributed by GM the club reads Chevy's Finest&nbsp; not GM's Finest, 
	Chevy's Finest. </font></p>
	<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF">In this site you will find 
	lots of pictures of what we do. Going to car shows, cruising on the weekends 
	and going to late night parties. There is also a link for any one that needs 
	assistance with their computer. There is from building a computer to just fixing a 
	computer. There is also I link here that displays the design of our sticker 
	its simple but looks good. You can also set it as your the emblem as your 
	background picture. Simply right click on the design and click on set as 
	Background.</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF">So thank you for visiting 
	our site. Hope you enjoy it.</font></p>
